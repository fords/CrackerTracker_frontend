# CrackerTracker Full Stack Project

This full stack project develops the application for the user to keep track of their food diets and time. The user has the ability to sign in, and create the food item in database. Only the user who created the items has the ability to see,update or delete them.
I as an engineer always want to plan, keep track of projects and see the statistics per days or weeks. We always do eat food daily without awareness, we don't know the nutrition value and calorie intake we are taking daily. The project allows the user to save the food items they take and able to reflect on the food intake.

<strong>Note that since Database is stored in free version of Heroku, action such as sign up and sign in can take up to 10 seconds. Please be patient when the request is waking up the server.</strong>
